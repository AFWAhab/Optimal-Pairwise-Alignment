# Optimal Pairwise Alignment
The purpose of this project, is to allow a user to find the optimal pairwise alignment, by having a useful GUI that allows you to see each step, and even go a step back if you are confused about something.

Further implementation, and current TODO's include:
- Fixing a bug that crashes the UI
- Setting up arrows to show where the value came from, instead of only having text explanations
- Setting up backtracking stepwise, so the user can see how one optimal alignment can be constructed, based on starting from the bottom right corner

- Also i would like to implement the algorithm for affine gap costs out in the future sometime.
