# Optimal Pairwise Alignment
The purpose of this project, is to allow a user to find the optimal pairwise alignment, by having a useful GUI that allows you to see each step, and even go a step back if you are confused about something.

Further implementation, and current TODO's include:
- Fixing UI such that it is cleaner, and makes more sense, right now the buttons are placed randomly, and only i know how the program works properly.
- Setting up backtracking stepwise, so the user can see how one optimal alignment can be constructed, based on starting from the bottom right corner
- Also i would like to implement the algorithm and backtracking for affine gap costs out in the future sometime.
